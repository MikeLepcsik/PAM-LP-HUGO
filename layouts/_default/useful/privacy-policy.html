              4) Content Delivery Network<br>
              4.1 AWS-CloudFront (Amazon)<br>
              On our website, we use the Content Delivery Network ("CDN") "AWS CloudFront"of the service provider
              "Amazon" (Amazon EU S.a. r.l.,38 avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg).<br>

              graphics, page content, or scripts) through a network of regionally distributed servers connected to the
              Internet. The use of Amazon's Content Delivery Network helps us optimize the loading speeds of our
              website.<br>
              The processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate
              interest in a secure and efficient provision, as well as improvement of the stability and functionality of
              our website.<br>

              4.2 Cloudflare<br>
              On our website, we use a so-called Content Delivery Network ("CDN") from technology service provider

              5) Cookies<br>
              In order to make the visit to our website attractive and to enable the use of certain functions, we use
              so-called cookies on various pages. These are small text files that are stored on your device. Some of the
              cookies we use are deleted after the end of the browser session, i.e. after closing your browser
              (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your device and allow us or our partner companies
              (third-party cookies) to recognize your browser the next time you visit (persistent cookies). When cookies
              are set, they collect and process specific user information such as browser and location data as well as
              IP address values. Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a predetermined duration, which may
              vary depending on the cookie.<br>
              Insofar as individual cookies implemented by us also process personal data, the processing is carried out
              in accordance with Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. b GDPR either for the execution of the contract or in accordance
              with Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. fGDPR in order to safeguard our legitimate interests in the best possible
              functionality of the website as well as a customer-friendly and effective design of the website visit.
              We may work with advertising partners to help us make our website more interesting for you. For this
              purpose, cookies from partner companies are also stored on your hard drive (third-party cookies) when you
              visit our website. If we cooperate with the above-mentioned advertising partners, you will be informed
              individually and separately about the use of such cookies and the extent of the information collected in
              each case within the following paragraphs.<br>
              Please note that you can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and can
              decide individually on their acceptance or exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in
              general. Each browser differs in the way it manages the cookie settings. This is described in the help
              menu of each browser, which explains how to change your cookie settings. These can be found for the
              respective browsers under the following links:<br>

              6) Contacting<br>
              Personal data is collected as part of the contact with us (e.g. via contact form or e-mail). The data
              collected in the case of a contact form can be seen from the respective contact form. This data will be
              stored and used exclusively for the purpose of answering your request or for contacting and the associated
              technical administration. The legal basis for the processing of this data is our legitimate interest in
              answering your request in accordance with Art. 6 sec. 1 lit.f GDPR. If your contact is aimed at concluding
              a contract, the additional legal basis for the processing is Art. lit Your data will be deleted after your
              request is processed. This is the case if it can be inferred from the circumstances that the facts in
              question have been finally clarified and that there are no statutory retention obligations.<br><br>

              7) Online appointment<br>
              Own function for online appointment<br>
              We process your personal data within the framework of the online appointment. You can see which data we
              collect for the online appointment from the respective entry form or the appointment query for the
              appointment. If certain data is necessary in order to be able to make an online appointment, we will
              identify it accordingly in the entry form or during the appointment query. If we provide you with a free
              text field in the entry form, you can describe your request there in more detail. You can then also
              control which additional data you want to enter. Your data will be stored and used exclusively for the
              purpose of the appointment. In the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract
              with you (this also applies to processing operations necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual
              measures), Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. b GDPR servesas the legal basis. If you have given us consent for the
              processing of your data, the processing will be carried out on the basis of Art. 6 sec. 1 lit.a GDPR.
              Consent given may be revoked at any time by sending a message to the controller named at the beginning of
              this declaration.<br><br>

              8) Registration with the portal or forum, data processing at the opening of a user account and for
              contract processing and data processing for order processing<br>
              8.1 Registration with the portal or forum<br>
              You can register on our website with personal data. The personal data processed for registration is
              determined by the input mask used for registration. We use the so-called doubleoptopt-in procedure for
              registration, i.e. Your registration will not be completed until you have previously confirmed your
              registration via a confirmation email sent to you for this purpose by clicking on the link contained
              therein. If your confirmation is not made within 24 hours, your registration will be automatically deleted
              from our database. The indication of the aforementioned data is mandatory. You can provide all other
              information voluntarily by using our portal.<br>
              If you use our portal, we will store your data required for the fulfilment of the contract, including any
              payment method details, until you permanently delete your access. Furthermore, we store the voluntary data
              you provide for the time of your use of the portal, unless you delete it beforehand. You can manage and
              change all information in the protected customer area. The legal basis is Art. lit. f DSGVO.<br>
              In addition, we store all content you publish (such as public posts, board entries, guestbook entries,
              etc.) to operate the website. We have a legitimate interest in providing the website with the full
              user-generated content. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. f GDPR. If you delete your account,
              your public statements, especially in the forum, will remain visible to all readers, but your account will
              no longer be accessible. All other data will be deleted in this case.<br>
              8.2 Data processing when opening a user account and for the execution of the contract<br>
              Pursuant to Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. b GDPR, personal data will continue to be collected and processed if you
              provide it to us for the execution of a contract or when opening a user account. The data collected can be
              seen from the respective input forms. Deletion of your user account is possible at any time and can be
              done by sending a message to the above address of the controller. We store and use the data you provide
              for the execution of the contract. After the complete execution of the contract or deletion of your user
              account, your data will be blocked with regard to tax and commercial retention periods and deleted after
              expiry of these periods, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or a legally
              permitted further use of data has been reserved by our site.<br><br>
              8.3 Data processing for order processing<br>
              In order to process your order, we cooperate with the following service providers, who support us in whole
              or in part in the execution of concluded contracts. Certain personal data will be transmitted to these
              service providers in accordance with the following information.<br>
              The personal data collected by us will be passed on to the credit institution responsible for the payment
              processing in the context of the contract processing, if this is necessary for the payment processing. If
              payment service providers are used, we will inform you explicitly below. The legal basis for the transfer
              of data is Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. b GDPR.<br><br>
              8.4 Use of payment service providers (payment services)<br>

              Stripe If you choose a payment method from the payment service provider Stripe, payment is processed by
              the payment service provider Stripe Payments Europe Ltd., 1 Grand Canal Street Lower, Grand Canal Dock,
              Dublin, Ireland, to whom we will share your information provided during the ordering process together with
              the information about your order (name, address, account number, bank code, possible credit card number,
              invoice amount, currency and transaction number) in accordance with Art. The transfer of your data takes
              place exclusively for the purpose of payment processing with the payment service provider Stripe Payments
              Europe Ltd. and only to the extent that it is necessary for this purpose. For more information about
              Stripe's privacy, see the URL https://stripe.com/de/privacy#translation.<br><br>

              9) Use of single sign-on procedures<br>
              9.1 Facebook Connect<br>
              On our website, you can register to create a customer account or to register using the social plugin
              "Facebook Connect" of the social network Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand
              Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook"), as part of the so-called single
              sign-ontechnology, if you have a Facebook profile. You can recognize the social plugins of "Facebook
              Connect" on our website by the blue button with the Facebook logo and the inscription "Register with
              Facebook" or "Connect with Facebook" or "Log in with Facebook" or "Sign in with Facebook".<br>
              When you visit a page of our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct
              connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to your
              browser and integrated into the page. Through this integration, Facebook receives the information that
              your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook
              profile or are not currently logged in to Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is
              transmitted by your browser directly to a Facebook Inc. server in the USA and stored there. These data
              processing operations are carried out in accordance with Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. f GDPR on the basis of
              Facebook's legitimate interest in displaying personalized advertising based on your browsing behaviour.
              By using this "Facebook Connect" button on our website, you also have the option to log in or register on
              our website using your Facebook user data. Only if you give your express consent in accordance with Art. 6
              sec. 1 lit. a GDPR prior to the registration process on the basis of a corresponding notice about the
              exchange of data withFacebook, we will receive the general and publicly accessible information stored in
              your profile by using the "Facebook Connect" button from Facebook, depending on your personal privacy
              settings on Facebook. This information includes the user ID, name, profile picture, age, and gender.<br>
              We would like to point out that after changes to Facebook's privacy policy and terms of use, if you give
              your consent, your friends' user IDs and the friends list may also be transferred if they have been marked
              as "public" in your Facebook privacy settings. The data transmitted by Facebook will be stored and
              processed by us for the purpose of creating a user account with the necessary data (address, first name,
              last name, address data, country, e-mail address, date of birth), if these have been approved by you on
              Facebook. Conversely, data (e.g. information about your surfing or purchasing behaviour) can be
              transferred from us to your Facebook profile on the basis of your consent.<br>
              The consent given can be revoked at any time by sending a message to the controller mentioned at the
              beginning of this data protection declaration.<br>
              The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook as
              well as your rights in this regard and setting options for the protection of your privacy can be found in
              Facebook's privacy policy: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php<br>
              If you do not want Facebook to assign the data collected via our website directly to your Facebook
              profile, you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website. You can also completely prevent the
              loading of Facebook plugins withadd-ons for your browser, e.g. with "Adblock Plus"<br>
              (https://adblockplus.org/de/).<br><br>

              9.2 Signing in with Apple<br>
              Single sign-on login with Apple Single-Sign-On and LinkedIn<br>
              "Single sign-on" or "single sign-on" or "authentication" means methods that allow users to log in to a
              provider of single sign-on procedures (e.g. a social network) with the help of a user account. The
              prerequisite for single sign-on authentication is that the users are registered with the respective single
              sign-on provider and enter the required access data in the online form provided for this purpose, or are
              already registered with the single sign-on provider and confirm the single sign-on registration via
              button.<br>
              Authentication is done directly with the respective single sign-on provider. In the context of such
              authentication, we receive a user ID with the information that the user is logged in to the respective
              single sign-on provider under this user ID and an ID that is no longer usable for us for other purposes
              (so-called "User Handle"). Whether additional data is transmitted to us depends solely on the single
              sign-on method used, on the data releases selected in the context of authentication and also on which data
              users have released to the single sign-on provider in the privacy or other settings of the user account.
              Depending on the single sign-on provider and the choice of users, different data can be, usually the email
              address and the user name. The password entered by the single sign-on provider as part of the single
              sign-on procedure is not visible to us, nor is it stored by us.<br>
              Users are asked to note that their data stored by us can be automatically compared with their user account
              with the single sign-on provider, but this is not always possible or actually done. For example, if the
              e-mail addresses of the users change, they must change them manually in their user account with us.
              If agreed with the users, we may process the single sign-on application within the scope of or before the
              fulfilment of the contract, insofar as the users have been requested, within the framework of a consent
              and otherwise use it on the basis of the legitimate interests of our side and the interests of the users
              in an effective and secure registration system.<br>

              13) Online-Marketing<br>
              13.1 Facebook Pixel for creating Custom Audiences with advanced data matching (with cookie-consent tool)
              Within our online offer, the so-called "Facebook pixel" of the social network Facebook is used in the mode
              of extended data matching, which is operated by Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Quare, Dublin 2,
              Ireland ("Facebook").<br>
              On the basis of his express consent, when a user clicks on an ad played on Facebook and placed by us, an
              addition is added to the URL of our linked page by Facebook Pixel. This URL parameter is then inscribed in
              the user's browser via cookie, which sets our linked page itself. In addition, this cookie collects
              specific customer data, such as the e-mail address that we collect on our website linked to the Facebook
              ad during transactions such as purchases, account registrations or registrations (extended data matching).
              The cookie is then read out by Facebook Pixel and allows the data, including the specific customer data,
              to be forwarded to Facebook.<br>
              With the help of the Facebook pixel with extended data matching, Facebook is on the one hand possible to
              precisely identify the visitors of our online offer as the target group for the display of advertisements
              (so-called "Facebook ads"). Accordingly, we use the Facebook pixel with extended data matching to display
              the Facebook ads we serve only to those Facebook users who have also shown an interest in our online offer
              or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interests in certain topics or products determined by the
              websites visited) that we transmit to Facebook (so-called "Custom Audiences"). With the help of the
              Facebook pixel with extended data matching, we also want to ensure that our Facebook ads meet the
              potential interest of users and do not have a harassing effect. This allows us to further evaluate the
              effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by tracking whether users have
              been redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called "conversionConversion").
              Compared to the standard version of Facebook Pixel, the advanced data matching feature helps us better
              measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns by capturing more associated conversions.
              All transmitted data is stored and processed by Facebook, so that a connection to the respective user
              profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with the
              Facebook data usage policy (https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/) ). The data may allow Facebook and
              its partners to run ads on and off Facebook.<br>
              These processing operations take place exclusively upon granting express consent in accordance with Art. 6
              sec. 1 lit. a GDPR.<br>
              Consent to the use of the Facebook pixel may only be given by users older than 13 years of age. If you are
              younger, we ask you to ask your legal guardian for permission.<br>
              The information generated by Facebook is usually transmitted to a Facebook server and stored there, where
              it can also be transmitted to the servers of Facebook Inc. in the USA. You can revoke your consent at any
              time with effect for the future. To exercise your revocation, remove the check mark placed in the
              "CookieConsentTool" on the websitenext to the "Facebook Pixel" setting.<br><br>
              13.2 Using Google Ads Conversion Tracking<br>
              This website uses the online advertising program "Google Ads" and, as part of Google Ads, the
              conversiontracking of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland
              ("Google"). We use the offer of Google Ads to draw attention to our attractive offers with the help of
              advertising materials (so-called Google Adwords) on external websites. We can determine how successful the
              individual advertising measures are in relation to the data of the advertising campaigns. In doing so, we
              are committed to displaying advertisements that are of interest to you, to make our website more
              interesting to you and to achieve a fair calculation of the advertising costs incurred.<br>
              The conversiontracking cookieis set when a user clicks on an ads ad placed by Google. Cookies are small
              text files that are stored on your device. These cookies usually expire after 30 days and are not used for
              personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet
              expired, Google and we can recognize that the user has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this
              page. Each Google Ads customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot therefore be tracked through
              the websites of Google Ads customers. The information collected using the conversioncookie is used to
              generate conversionstatistics for Google Ads customers who haveopted for conversiontracking. Customers
              will find out the total number of users who clicked on their ad and have been redirected to a page with a
              conversiontracking tag. However, you will not receive any information that can be used to personally
              identify users. If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can block this use by disabling the
              Google ConversionTracking cookie via your Internet browser under thekeyword "User Settings". They are then
              not included in the conversiontracking statistics. We use Google Ads on the basis of our legitimate
              interest in targeted advertising in accordance with Art. 6 sec. 1 lit.f GDPR. In the context of the use of
              Google Ads, personal data may also be transferred to the servers of Google LLC. in the USA.<br>

              13.3 Google Marketing Platform<br>
              This website uses the online marketing tool Google Marketing Platform of the operator Google Ireland
              Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland ("GMP").<br>
              GMP uses cookies to display ads relevant to users, improve campaign performance reports, or prevent a user
              from seeing the same ads multiple times. Using a cookie ID, Google records which ads are displayed in
              which browser and can thus prevent them from being displayed multiple times. The processing is based on
              our legitimate interest in the optimal marketing of our website in accordance with Art. 6 sec. 1 lit.f
              GDPR.<br>
              In addition, GMP can use cookie IDs to collect so-called conversions related to ad requests. This is the
              case, for example, when a user sees a GMP ad and later, when using the same browser, visits the
              advertiser's website and buys something through that website. According to Google, GMP cookies do not
              contain any personal information.<br>
              Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google
              server. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected by Google through the use
              of this tool and therefore inform you according to our state of knowledge as follows: By integrating GMP,
              Google receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding part of our website or clicked on
              an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can assign the visit to your
              account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a possibility that the
              provider will find out and store your IP address. In the context of the use of GMP, personal data may also
              be transferred to the servers of Google LLC. in the USA.<br>
              If you wish to object to participation in this tracking procedure, you can disable cookies for
              conversiontracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain www.googleadservices.com (see
              https://www.google.de/settings/ads), which will be deleted if you disable your cookies. Alternatively, you
              can contact the Digital Advertising Alliance at the Internet address www.aboutads.info about the setting
              of cookies and make your desired settings. Finally, you can set your browser so that you are informed
              about the setting of cookies and decide individually on their acceptance or exclude the acceptance of
              cookies for certain cases or in general. If cookies are not accepted, the functionality of our website may
              be limited.<br>

              17.4 - Google Maps<br>
              On our website we use Google Maps (API) of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04
              E5W5, Ireland ("Google"). Google Maps is a web service for displaying interactive (land) maps to visualize
              geographic information. By using this service, you will be shown our location and any access will be made
              easier.<br>
              Information about your use of our website (e.g. your IP address) is transmitted to Google servers and
              stored there, and this may also result in a transmission to the servers of Google LLC. in the USA. This is
              done regardless of whether Google provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether a
              user account exists. If you are logged in to Google, your data will be directly associated with your
              account. If you do not want to be assigned to your google profile, you must log out before activating the
              button. Google stores your data (even for users who are not logged in) as user profiles and evaluates
              them. The collection, storage and evaluation are carried out in accordance with Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. f GDPR
              on the basis of Google's legitimate interest in displaying personalized advertising, market research
              and/or the needs-based design of Google websites. You have the right to object to the creation of these
              user profiles, whereby you must contact Google to exercise them. If you do not agree with the future
              transmission of your data to Google in the context of the use of Google Maps, it is also possible to
              completely deactivate the web service of Google Maps by turning off the JavaScript application in your
              browser. Google Maps and thus also the map display on this website cannot then be used.<br>

              involved and the scope and the intended impact of such processing, and your right to be informed of the
              guarantees provided for in Article 46 GDPR in the case of forwarding your data to third countries;
              - Right to rectification in accordance with Article 16 GDPR: You have the right to immediate rectification
              of any inaccurate data concerning you and/or completion of your incomplete data stored by us;<br>

              personal data if the requirements of Art. 17 sec. 1 GDPR are met. However, this right does not exist, in

              information, for the fulfilment of a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the
              assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims;<br>
              - Right to restrict processing in accordance with Article 18 GDPR: You have the right to request the
              restriction of the processing of your personal data as long as the accuracy of your data, which you
              dispute, is verified, if you refuse to delete your data due to improper data processing and instead
              require the restriction of the processing of your data if you need your data to assert, exercise or defend
              legal claims , since we no longer need this information after the purpose has been achieved, or if you
              have objected on the grounds of your particular situation, as long as it is not yet clear whether our
              legitimate reasons prevail;<br>
              - Right to be informs in accordance with Article 19 GDPR: If you have asserted the right to rectification,
              erasure or restriction of the processing against the controller, the controller is obliged to notify all
              recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed this rectification or deletion of
              the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate
              effort. They have the right to be informed of these recipients.<br>
              - Right to data portability in accordance with Article 20 GDPR: You have the right to receive your

              a given consent to the processing of data at any time with effect for the future. In the event of
              revocation, we will immediately delete the data concerned, unless further processing can be based on a
              legal basis for non-consent processing. The revocation of consent does not affect the legality of the
              processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation;<br>
              - Right to complain under Article 77 GDPR: If you consider that the processing of personal data concerning
              you is in breach of the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in
              particular in the Member State of your place of residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged
              infringement, without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.<br><br>

              The duration of the storage of personal data is determined on the basis of the respective legal basis, the
              purpose of the processing and, if relevant, additionally on the basis of the respective statutory
              retention period (e.g. commercial and tax retention periods).<br>

              1 lit. a GDPR, this data is stored until the data subject withdraws his consent.<br>
              If there are statutory retention periods for data that are processed in the context of legal or
              business-like obligations on the basis of Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. b GDPR, these data are routinely deleted
              after the retention periods have expired, provided that they are no longer necessary for the fulfilment of

              As of: 08. 10.2020<br><br>

              Our social media appearances<br>
              Data processing through social networks<br>
              We maintain publicly accessible profiles on social networks. The social networks we use in detail can be
              found below.<br>
              Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. can usually comprehensively analyse your user behaviour
              when you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g. like buttons or
              advertising banners). By visiting our social media presences, numerous data protection-relevant processing
              processes are triggered. In detail:<br>
              If you are logged into your social media account and visit our social media presence, the operator of the
              social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. However, your personal data may also be
              collected if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In
              this case, this data collection takes place, for example, via cookies, which are stored on your terminal
              device or by collecting your IP address.<br>
              With the help of the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user
              profiles in which your preferences and interests are stored. In this way, you can see interest-based
              advertising inside and outside your social media presence. If you have an account with the respective
              social network, the interest-based advertisement may be displayed on all devices on which you are logged
              in or logged in.<br>
              Please also note that we cannot track all processing processes on the social media portals. Depending on
              the provider, further processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social
              media portals. Details of this can be found in the terms of use and data protection provisions of the
              respective social media portals.<br>
              Legal basis<br>
              Our social media presences are intended to ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet. This is a
              legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by
              the social networks may be based on different legal bases, which must be indicated by the operators of the
              social networks (e.g. consent within the meaning of Article 6 sec. 1 lit. a GDPR).<br>
              Responsible and assertion of rights<br>
              When you visit one of our social media sites (e.g. Facebook), we are jointly responsible for the data
              processing operations triggered during this visit together with the operator of the social media platform.
              You can assert your rights (information, rectification, deletion, restriction of processing, data
              portability and complaint) both in our right and please of the operator of the respective social media
              portal (e.g. Facebook).<br>
              Please note that despite our joint responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have a
              full influence on the data processing processes of the social media portals. Our possibilities depend
              significantly on the company policy of the respective provider.<br>
              Speicherdauer<br>
              The data collected directly by us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon
              as the purpose for their storage is omitted, you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage or
              the purpose for the data storage is omitted. Stored cookies remain on your device until you delete them.
              Mandatory legal provisions - in no matter retention periods remain unaffected.<br>
              We have no influence on the storage time of your data, which is stored by the operators of the social
              networks for their own purposes. For details, please contact the social network operators directly (e.g.
              in their privacy policy, see below).<br>
