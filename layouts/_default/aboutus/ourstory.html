        </h2>
        <div class="mt-30 row f-18 medium color-heading text-center text-md-left blocks" data-aos-duration="600" data-aos="fade-down"
        data-aos-delay="0">
          <div class="mt-30 col-md-6 text-adaptive">The idea got born when I was seeking a quick and easy solution for a
            workspace at the beginning of 2019. No matter which company I asked, they needed me to read and sign an
            immersive amount of paperwork just to get signed up for a single work desk. It was a HORROR and entirely
            OUTDATED!
            <br><br>
            Since that time, the idea was hanging around, and I spoke to a bunch of different people about it. One of
            them was Pavel. We met in an old shady Hotel lobby in the middle of Dortmund at the End of 2019. What shall
            I say… we, back then, just Pavel & me (Marius), discussed some past projects very briefly, exchanged crazy
            ideas, and realized relatively quick a kind of bonding…  #BROMANCE TIME! 
            <br><br>
            Short later the same week, we concluded: we will develop DeskNow and become the AirBnB in the CoWorking
            Industry. #AMAZINGENERGY BOOST!
            <br><br>
            It did not take us very long to realize that we definitely need more help. Through some beautiful
            coincidence, I knew Anca and introduced her to our growing idea. Anca needed a full night to digest and
            joined at the beginning of 2020 to complete us with her energetic approach: Pavel, our balanced technical
            guru, Anca, our design-oriented energy lady, and me, the family gluey mentor guy. #THETEAM
          </div>
          <div class="mt-30 col-md-6 text-adaptive">Our concept for DeskNow was clear, the services around it grew with
            each day, and since then, we started working with a lot of passion and some external coding help creating a
            really colossal platform. 
            <br><br>
            On our journey, we realized DeskNow is more, and it can’t properly work without a SideKick … a Powerful
            Asset Management solution… the birth of PAM. #AMAZINGENERGY BOOST AGAIN.
            <br><br>
            Our state-of-the-art and free-to-use POWER TOOL to manage any of your CoWorking, FlexOffice, Meeting room,
            or Shared Office properties. It’s been a whole intensive journey until now, and we are more than excited to
            be that short before launching. Now it’s time to help our all baby making its first steps.

          every day, not even counting in the additional unoccupied desks
          since COVID-19 kicked in. Still, millions of people are tired of commuting on a day-to-day basis to there
          workplaces. In other cases, it's even worse, where people do not even have a proper workspace because their
          flat is too small, or their earnings don't allow them one. We want to make it available for everybody… from
          low or no cost to a fancy high-end space. With DeskNow we are building the platform helping everybody to find
          hers or his sweet-spot, motivating them the most.
