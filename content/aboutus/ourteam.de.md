		"AncaText": "Our big city girl, full of positive energy and always focused on maximizing the user experience. Of course, the rest of #THETEAM is energetic and cheerful, too; Anca has just a sparkle more... every day. User experience and a smooth design are not just tasks for our Anca, itâ€™s a mission, sometimes even close to her own crusade ðŸ˜‰â€¯ Of course, there is a downside to it: no talks before the first-morning espresso!!!",

        "MariusText": "One of the most charismatic persons youÂ´ll ever get to know, and that is a promise(!), wait till you meet him. His dreams and visions have become a passion for many... His positivity and energy will inspire anybody who has a will to succeed (in life or a professional level). Despite of being the initiator, *he had the brilliant idea for DeskNow* working with Marius is challenging and fun. He acts like a mentor, sometimes as a father and even though he has the answers almost all the time, he is empowering us to search till we find it.",

        "PavelText": "If you think you know the tech world, you never met with him. Our meat loving technical brain is always online, and this is not just a phrase, he is literally always in exchange with our programmers. Constantly seeking for improvements, some new ideas, the latest APPs to improve the backend functionality and supply our lovely customers with even more. Our always calm tech brain has also his Kryptonite and guess what it is? #VEGGIES!!! Strange: he really would prefer to starve before eating vegetables.",

        "MikeText": "No Code is safe from being edited, modified, and optimized by our programming guru Mike! Loaded with vitamin D from the Canary sun, Mike takes care of a clean and well programed code for our website. What for others looks like hieroglyphics for him is a Rubik cube to be solved under 2 minutes. Not only he has a great experience in programming and landscape design (we know, great combo, right?) but his sense of humanity and family spirit makes him a perfect match for DeskNow."
