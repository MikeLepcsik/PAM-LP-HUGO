		"Text": "The idea got born when I was seeking a quick and easy solution for a workspace at the beginning of 2019. No matter which company I asked, they needed me to read and sign an immersive amount of paperwork just to get signed up for a single work desk. It was a HORROR and entirely OUTDATED! <br><br> Since that time, the idea was hanging around, and I spoke to a bunch of different people about it. One of them was Pavel. We met in an old shady Hotel lobby in the middle of Dortmund at the End of 2019. What shall I say… we, back then, just Pavel & me (Marius), discussed some past projects very briefly, exchanged crazy ideas, and realized relatively quick a kind of bonding…  #BROMANCE TIME!  <br><br> Short later the same week, we concluded: we will develop DeskNow and become the AirBnB in the CoWorking Industry. #AMAZINGENERGY BOOST! <br><br> It did not take us very long to realize that we definitely need more help. Through some beautiful coincidence, I knew Anca and introduced her to our growing idea. Anca needed a full night to digest and joined at the beginning of 2020 to complete us with her energetic approach: Pavel, our balanced technical guru, Anca, our design-oriented energy lady, and me, the family gluey mentor guy. #THETEAM",

		"Text2": "Our concept for DeskNow was clear, the services around it grew with each day, and since then, we started working with a lot of passion and some external coding help creating a really colossal platform. <br><br> On our journey, we realized DeskNow is more, and it can’t properly work without a SideKick … a Powerful Asset Management solution… the birth of PAM. #AMAZINGENERGY BOOST AGAIN. <br><br> Our state-of-the-art and free-to-use POWER TOOL to manage any of your CoWorking, FlexOffice, Meeting room, or Shared Office properties. It’s been a whole intensive journey until now, and we are more than excited to be that short before launching. Now it’s time to help our all baby making its first steps."

		"Text": "There are thousands of empty spaces available every day, not even counting in the additional unoccupied desks since COVID-19 kicked in. Still, millions of people are tired of commuting on a day-to-day basis to there workplaces. In other cases, it's even worse, where people do not even have a proper workspace because their flat is too small, or their earnings don't allow them one. We want to make it available for everybody… from low or no cost to a fancy high-end space. With DeskNow we are building the platform helping everybody to find hers or his sweet-spot, motivating them the most."
