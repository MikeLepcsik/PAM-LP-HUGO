		"Title": "Our Story",
		"Text": "The idea got born when I was seeking a quick and easy solution for a workspace at the beginning of 2019. No matter which company I asked, they needed me to read and sign an immersive amount of paperwork just to get signed up for a single work desk. It was a HORROR and entirely OUTDATED! <br><br> Since that time, the idea was hanging around, and I spoke to a bunch of different people about it. One of them was Pavel. We met in an old shady Hotel lobby in the middle of Dortmund at the End of 2019. What shall I sayâ€¦ we, back then, just Pavel & me (Marius), discussed some past projects very briefly, exchanged crazy ideas, and realized relatively quick a kind of bondingâ€¦â€¯ #BROMANCE TIME!â€¯ <br><br> Short later the same week, we concluded: we will develop DeskNow and become the AirBnB in the CoWorking Industry. #AMAZINGENERGY BOOST! <br><br> It did not take us very long to realize that we definitely need more help. Through some beautiful coincidence, I knew Anca and introduced her to our growing idea. Anca needed a full night to digest and joined at the beginning of 2020 to complete us with her energetic approach: Pavel, our balanced technical guru, Anca, our design-oriented energy lady, and me, the family gluey mentor guy. #THETEAM",

		"Text2": "Our concept for DeskNow was clear, the services around it grew with each day, and since then, we started working with a lot of passion and some external coding help creating a really colossal platform.â€¯<br><br> On our journey, we realized DeskNow is more, and it canâ€™t properly work without a SideKick â€¦ a Powerful Asset Management solutionâ€¦ the birth of PAM. #AMAZINGENERGY BOOST AGAIN. <br><br> Our state-of-the-art and free-to-use POWER TOOL to manage any of your CoWorking, FlexOffice, Meeting room, or Shared Office properties. Itâ€™s been a whole intensive journey until now, and we are more than excited to be that short before launching. Now itâ€™s time to help our all baby making its first steps."

        "SubTitle": "We will make \"Work Where You Want!\" available to everybody worldwide",
		"Text": "There are thousands of empty spaces available every day, not even counting in the additional unoccupied desks since COVID-19 kicked in. Still, millions of people are tired of commuting on a day-to-day basis to there workplaces. In other cases, it's even worse, where people do not even have a proper workspace because their flat is too small, or their earnings don't allow them one. We want to make it available for everybodyâ€¦ from low or no cost to a fancy high-end space. With DeskNow we are building the platform helping everybody to find hers or his sweet-spot, motivating them the most."

		"AncaText": "Our big city girl, full of positive energy and always focused on maximizing the user experience. Of course, the rest of #THETEAM is energetic and cheerful, too; Anca has just a sparkle more... every day. User experience and a smooth design are not just tasks for our Anca, itâ€™s a mission, sometimes even close to her own crusade ðŸ˜‰â€¯ Of course, there is a downside to it: no talks before the first-morning espresso!!!",

        "MariusText": "One of the most charismatic persons youÂ´ll ever get to know, and that is a promise(!), wait till you meet him. His dreams and visions have become a passion for many... His positivity and energy will inspire anybody who has a will to succeed (in life or a professional level). Despite of being the initiator, *he had the brilliant idea for DeskNow* working with Marius is challenging and fun. He acts like a mentor, sometimes as a father and even though he has the answers almost all the time, he is empowering us to search till we find it.",

        "PavelText": "If you think you know the tech world, you never met with him. Our meat loving technical brain is always online, and this is not just a phrase, he is literally always in exchange with our programmers. Constantly seeking for improvements, some new ideas, the latest APPs to improve the backend functionality and supply our lovely customers with even more. Our always calm tech brain has also his Kryptonite and guess what it is? #VEGGIES!!! Strange: he really would prefer to starve before eating vegetables.",

        "MikeText": "No Code is safe from being edited, modified, and optimized by our programming guru Mike! Loaded with vitamin D from the Canary sun, Mike takes care of a clean and well programed code for our website. What for others looks like hieroglyphics for him is a Rubik cube to be solved under 2 minutes. Not only he has a great experience in programming and landscape design (we know, great combo, right?) but his sense of humanity and family spirit makes him a perfect match for DeskNow."
